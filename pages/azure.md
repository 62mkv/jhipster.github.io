# <i class="fa fa-cloud-upload"></i> Deploying to Microsoft Azure

There are several options to deploy your JHipster application to the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/?WT.mc_id=online-jhipster-judubois).

- The easiest way is to use [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/?WT.mc_id=online-jhipster-judubois): you will use a JHipster sub-generator
  to deploy a monolithic application which will be managed by Microsoft Azure.
- If you are using Spring Boot microservices, you can use another JHispter sub-generator to deploy your applications to
 [Azure Spring Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spring-cloud/?WT.mc_id=online-jhipster-judubois).
- As with any Docker and Kubernetes cloud provider, you can use the JHipster Docker and Kubernetes support to deploy your images to Microsoft Azure.

## Installing the "az CLI"

You can manage your Azure resources using the [Web-based Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=online-jhipster-judubois) or using the Azure
command-line inteface, also known as the "az CLI".

As with JHipster we always automate everything, installing this "az CLI" is mandatory in order to work with any of the below options.

To install the az CLI on your machine, [follow the "Install the Azure CLI" official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli/?WT.mc_id=online-jhipster-judubois).
