## Troubleshooting

### The JDL import only finds one entity when matching MS baseName

This is a known issue regarding the parsing system and fixing it is tricky.
The obvious workaround is to use different names for the microservice and the entities inside.

See [JHipster Core issue #308](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-core/issues/308) for more information.
